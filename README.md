âœ… Task Completed: Visualizing Accident Hotspots & Contributing Factors
This repository contains the work completed for Task 5 of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal of the task was to perform data analysis and visualization on accident data to identify major hotspots and contributing factors using Python.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
Identify accident hotspots using visual analytics.

Analyze and highlight major contributing factors such as:

Poor road surfaces

Low lighting conditions

Overspeeding

Evaluate classification models for real-world data.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack & Tools
Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas â€“ Data manipulation

seaborn, matplotlib â€“ Data visualization

scikit-learn â€“ Model evaluation and classification

imblearn â€“ SMOTE for handling class imbalance
